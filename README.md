I wrote the first few solutions in the [Kotlin playground](http://try.kotlinlang.org) using the Advent of Code 
template.  Getting these to compile and run on the command-line is an exercise left to the reader. I
switched to using [Kotlin scripts](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/command-line.html#using-the-command-line-to-run-scripts) later on.
